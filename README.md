## 📘 Overview

**Smart Workspace Manager** is a C++ application built to simulate a real-world office management system.

It efficiently handles:
- Employee records  
- Department data  
- Meeting scheduling  

The system uses **dynamic memory**, **modular code**, and **simple text file storage** to persist data across program runs.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 👨‍💼 Employee Management
- Add & remove employees  
- Update attendance and performance  
- Determine bonus eligibility  
- View complete employee details  
- Automatically link employee to department  

### 🏢 Department Management
- Create & delete departments  
- Store and track employee IDs  
- Display department details  
- Identify top performer  
- Compute average performance  
- Check department capacity  

### 📅 Meeting Management
- Create meetings with topic, date, and time  
- Check & prevent scheduling clashes  
- Add participants using employee IDs  
- Display meeting & participant details  

---

## 💾 Data Persistence

All data is automatically saved to:

```

employee.txt
departments.txt
meetings.txt

```

Data is reloaded every time the program starts.

## 🧠 Data Flow & Architecture

### 1. **Global Resources (global.cpp)**
Handles dynamic memory and global state.

- Allocates arrays for:
  - Employees  
  - Departments  
  - Meetings  

- Stores counters:
  - `employee_count`
  - `department_count`
  - `meeting_count`

- Core functions:
  - `initializeMemory()`
  - `freeMemory()`

---

### 2. **Core Modules**

| File | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| **employee.cpp** | Employee CRUD, performance, bonus, department linking, file I/O |
| **department.cpp** | Department creation, capacity management, metrics, file I/O |
| **meeting.cpp** | Meetings, clash detection, participants, file persistence |
| **main.cpp** | Menu-driven interface and navigation |

---

### 3. **Struct & Header Definitions (project.h)**

Contains all shared structures:
- `Employee`  
- `Department`  
- `Meeting`

Also includes:
- Global pointers  
- Function prototypes  
- Shared constants  

---
